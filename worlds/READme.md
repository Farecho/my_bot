## `worlds/` Directory

This folder holds **custom Gazebo world files** used for simulating the robot in different environments.

- I'll be adding my `.world` files here to create new simulation environments.
- These worlds are used by `launch_sim.launch.py` to launch Gazebo with the desired environment.
